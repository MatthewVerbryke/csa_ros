## Summary

This repository contains software to implement a modified version of JPL's Canonical Software Architecture (CSA) format with ROS using Python.

Currently, this is very much a work in progress. The Directive/Response message formats and the absolute basic framework of the module subcomponents have been coded and tested. Come back later to see further progress.

Next steps include:
- Coding the structure of the overall module to utilize these subcomponents
- Determine how parameters, rules, criteria, ... will be handled
- Implementation of an activity managment component
- Improving the capabilities of all the basic components
- Better documentation on how it works
